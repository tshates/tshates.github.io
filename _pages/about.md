I am a scientist with a background in plant-infecting viruses and their effects on cultivated and (especially) wild plants. For my PhD research, I studied the ecology and epidemiology of a crop virus in wild systems using molecular tools to detect viral infections under the guidance of 
<a href="https://maucklab.ucr.edu/lab-members/dr-kerry-mauck/">Dr. Kerry Mauck</a>. Through my graduate work, I've gained experience and skills across multiple disciplines.  <br><br>

In general, my interests include detection of infectious diseases, with a special focus on arthropod-borne pathogens and their vectors.     

Where am I now? 
======
I am currently a Scientist in R&D Infectious Disease at Quest Diagnostics. I now work with serology assays and infectious disease diagnostics - a very different group of “bugs” from my dissertation. <br><br>
