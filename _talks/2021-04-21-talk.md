While an organizer of the R-Ladies Riverside Chapter, I presented a tutorial on creating maps using R. I used publically available data to show how to take coordinate data (from a dataframe) and create maps using multiple different packages and methods. R is a versatile coding langauge, and I have experience using it for analyzing data and creating visuals - such as the maps in this video.
